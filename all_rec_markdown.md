## Initial Medical Assessment and Management
##### Recommendations

### LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-a-legend.png)A = Consistent, good-quality, patient-oriented evidence (example: at least one large randomized control trial, meta-analysis or systematic review with homogeneity, or large, high- quality, multi-centre cohort study)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-b-legend.png)B = Inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence (example: smaller cohort studies, case studies or control trials with limitations)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-c-legend.png)C = Consensus, usual practice, opinion or weaker-level evidence

  

2.1  

**Physicians or nurse practitioners should perform a comprehensive medical assessment on all children/adolescents with a suspected concussion or with acute head or spine trauma.**  

Include a clinical history, physical examination, and the evidence-based use of diagnostic tests or imaging as needed.

Diagnostic tools and definitions:

*   [Living Guideline Manage Acute and Prolonged Symptoms Algorithm](https://pedsconcussion.com/manage-acute-and-prolonged-concussion-symptoms-algorithm/)
*   [2023 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Diagnostic Criteria for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (Figure 2 and box 1 and 2)](https://www.archives-pmr.org/article/S0003-9993(23)00297-6/fulltext) 
*   [Definition of Sport-related Concussion: 6th Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/11/695)

2.1a  

**Take a comprehensive clinical history.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png)

Details that should be collected in the clinical history include:

*   Patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, gender).
*   Assess injury mechanism and symptoms at the time of injury.
*   Assess symptom burden at the time of initial presentation using _age-appropriate standardized symptom inventory_.
    *   Number of symptoms.
    *   Severity of symptoms.
    *   Type of symptoms.
*   Presence of loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and red flags (seizures, neck pain, focal neurological deficits).
*   Review mental health (Domain 8: Mental Health and Psychosocial Factors).
*   Past medical history (e.g., previous concussions, migraine or non-specific headaches, mental health disorders, coagulopathy, other risk modifiers that may delay recovery). Note the duration until recovery from previous concussions (i.e., within 7-10 days or persisting).
*   Allergies/immunizations.
*   Ask whether the child/adolescent is taking any substances or medications: Prescribed or over-the-counter medications or supplements, alcohol, or recreational drugs including cannabis. These substances may mask or modify concussion symptoms.
*   Ask about school, activities, work, and sports participation.

2.1b  

**Perform a comprehensive physical examination that includes:**

*   Vital signs (resting heart rate and blood pressure).
*   Level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale).
*   Mental status.
*   [Tool: Living Guideline Core Physical Examination: Neurological and Cervical Spine Examination](https://pedsconcussion.com/pedsconcussion-physical-examination/) 
*   A complete neurological examination (cranial nerve, motor, sensory, reflex, cerebellar, gait, and balance testing)

2.1c  

**Consider CT of the brain or cervical spine only in patients whom, after a medical assessment, a structural intracranial or cervical spine injury is suspected; do not conduct routine neuroimaging for the purpose of diagnosing concussion.** 

Most children/adolescents who sustain an acute head injury or suspected concussion do not need diagnostic imaging. 

Use the following tools, as appropriate, to determine the need for CT imaging in patients with acute head trauma:

*   Tool 2.2: [PECARN Management Algorithm for Children after Head Trauma](https://pedsconcussion.com/pecarn-head/).
*   Tool 2.3: [CATCH2 Rule](https://pedsconcussion.com/tool-2-3-the-canadian-assessment-of-tomography-for-childhood-head-injury-2-catch2-rule/)
*   Tool 2.4: [Algorithm for the Management of the Pediatric Patient ≥ 2 years with Minor Head Trauma](https://pedsconcussion.com/tool-2-4-algorithym-for-the-management-of-the-pediatric-patient-2-years-with-minor-head-trauma/)

Although validated clinical decision-making rules are highly sensitive, these tools are meant to assist, but not replace, clinical judgment. CT scans should be used judiciously as the exposure of children/adolescents to the effects of ionizing radiation carries a small increased lifetime risk of cancer. If a structural brain injury is suspected in a patient with acute head trauma undergoing initial medical assessment in the office setting, urgent referral to an Emergency Department should be arranged.

Diagnostic imaging of the spine should be considered when symptoms are suggestive of structural cervical spine injury. Imaging should be considered in patients with severe neck pain, tenderness or clinical evidence of radiculopathy or myelopathy. The choice of imaging modality (plain radiographs, CT or MRI of the cervical spine) should be guided by the suspected pathology.

Patients with positive traumatic findings observed on diagnostic imaging of the brain or spine should be urgently referred to a neurosurgeon for consultation.

2.1d  

**Note common modifiers that may delay recovery and use a clinical risk score to predict risk of prolonged symptoms.**

Tool: [Predicting Persistent Post-Concussive Problems in Pediatrics (5P): Score Calculator](http://www.5pconcussion.com/en/scorecalculator).

Modifiers that may delay recovery:

*   Age (increased risk with increased age).
*   Sex (female).
*   Duration of recovery from a previous concussion.
*   High pre-injury symptom burden.
*   High symptom burden at initial presentation.
*   Clinical evidence of vestibular or oculomotor dysfunction.
*   Vestibular-Ocular Reflex (VOR) and tandem gait parameters.
*   Orthostatic intolerance.
*   Personal and family history of migraines.
*   History of learning or behavioural difficulties.
*   Personal and family history of mental health.
*   Family socioeconomic status/education.

2.2  

**Provide verbal information and written (electronic) handouts regarding the course of recovery and when the child/adolescent can return to school/activity/sport/work.**

Consider the following anticipatory guidance (verbal reassurance) in order to reduce anxiety, set realistic expectations, promote recovery, and prevent re-injury: 

*   **Tool 2.0: [Living Guideline Return to Activity Sports and School Protocol](https://pedsconcussion.com/return-to-activity-sport-school/)** 
*   Most patients recover fully from concussion even though the recovery rate is variable and unpredictable.
*   Current symptoms are expected and common.
*   The burden and distress parents/caregivers of children/adolescents who have sustained a concussion may experience is common.
*   Children typically recover in 1-4 weeks but some children/adolescents will have symptoms at one month and beyond and need to be monitored/seek additional care. Females aged 13-18 years have an increased risk of prolonged recovery.
*   Recommendation 2.3 Recommend graduated return to physical and cognitive activity. 
*   Return to school should be step-wise as soon as the student is able and include temporary academic modifications based on the student’s symptom tolerance. See Domain 12: [Return-to-School and Work](https://pedsconcussion.com/section/b/#domain-12) for more recommendations and a list of return-to-school resources.

2.3  

**Recommend graduated return to cognitive and physical activity to promote recovery.**

While most children/adolescents fully recover, the recovery rate can be variable. Return to physical and cognitive activity should be individualized based on activity tolerance and symptom presentation.

*   Tool 2.0: [Living Guideline Return to Activity Sports and School Protocol](https://pedsconcussion.com/return-to-activity-sport-school/) (Updated Sept 2023)

2.3a  

**Recommend an initial 24-48 hour period of relative rest\*.**

Level of Evidence: **A** Gradual return to physical activity. **B** Gradual return to cognitive activity.

\*Relative rest: activities of daily living including walking and other light physical and cognitive activities are permitted as tolerated. (this definition has been harmonized with and adapted from the Amsterdam [International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/11/695))

See [Living Guideline Return to Sport/Activity and School Protocols](https://pedsconcussion.com/return-to-activity-sport-school/)

**Updated Sept 2023**

2.3b  

**2.3b Recommend that physical and cognitive activity be started 24-48 hours after a concussion increasing the intensity gradually as part of the initial treatment for acute concussion. Activities that pose no/low risk of sustaining a concussion should be resumed even if mild residual symptoms are present.**

Start with ‘light-intensity’ aerobic exercise, progressing to ‘moderate-intensity’ aerobic exercise, and continue to increase the intensity over time as symptoms are tolerated.\* Suggest taking a break from the activity if the increase in symptoms is _more than mild and brief_\*\* or the symptoms cannot be tolerated. 

Level of Evidence:  A- Physical activity, B- Cognitive activity

**Updated: Sept 2023**

\*_Light-intensity aerobic exercise:_ Target heart rate of up to approximately 55% of the person’s maximum heart rate (estimated according to age- 220 beats/min minus age in years)

_Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise_: Target heart rate of up to approximately 70% of the person’s maximum heart rate

\*\*_More than mild and brief_ symptom exacerbation: An increase in current concussion symptoms of no more than 2 points on a 0-10 point scale for less than an hour compared to the resting value prior to the physical activity.

2.3c  

**Recommend that patients avoid activities associated with a risk of contact, fall, or collisions such as high-speed and/or contact activities and full-contact sport that may increase the risk of sustaining another concussion until medically cleared (see Recommendation 4.1: _Consider patients for medical clearance to return to full-contact activities and sport/gameplay if clinical criteria have been met._** _Note: An update to Rec 4.1 was performed Sept 2023_**_)._**

*   Advise/emphasize that returning to full-contact sport or high-risk activities before the child/adolescent has recovered increases the risk of delayed recovery and for sustaining another more severe concussion or more serious injury.

2.3d  

**Refer select patients (e.g., highly-active or competitive athletes, those who are not tolerating a graduated return to physical activity, or those who are slow to recover) following acute injury to a medically supervised interdisciplinary team with the ability to individually assess aerobic exercise tolerance and to prescribe aerobic exercise treatment.** **This exercise tolerance assessment can be as early as 48 hours following acute injury.** Level of Evidence:![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-A.png)

2.4  

**Provide education and guidance regarding strategies to promote recovery.**

2.4a  

**Advise on the importance of sleep and discuss sleep hygiene.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

Advise that consistent sleep schedules and duration of sleep may contribute to general recovery from a concussion and alleviate symptoms such as mood, anxiety, pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties if these are present.

*   Link: [Concussion Handbook](http://www.hollandbloorview.ca/concussionhandbook)  (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital)

2.4b  

**Advise on maintaining social networks and interactions (as tolerated). Children/adolescents should participate (modified as needed) in rewarding social activities that avoid the risk of re-injury. Social engagement may promote recovery and reduce the risk of mental health issues.** 

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

Updated Sept 2023

2.4c  

**Screentime should be minimized in the first 48 hours after injury. After the initial period of relative rest, the use of devices with screens may be gradually resumed. The use of these devices can be increased according to symptom tolerance as the child/adolescent recovers.**

Level of Evidence: B

Updated Sept 2023

2.4d  

**Advise on avoiding alcohol and other recreational drugs after a concussion.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

Alcohol and recreational drugs may have a negative effect on concussion recovery. Avoiding alcohol or drugs prevents a child/adolescent from self-medicating and resorting to drugs to relieve symptoms. Impaired judgment after a concussion could lead to risky behaviour that causes further harm or may delay the identification of complications.

2.4e  

**Advise to avoid driving during the first 24-48 hours after a concussion. Advise patients to begin driving when they are feeling improved, can concentrate sufficiently to feel safe behind the wheel, and when the act of driving does not provoke significant concussion symptoms.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

Provide verbal information related to when an adolescent should return to driving during recovery from a concussion. Driving is a complex coordinated process that requires vision, balance, reaction time, judgment, cognition, and attention. Concussion may have affected some or all of these skills. Driving impairments have been shown to exist even in asymptomatic patients 48 hours after a concussion. Avoiding driving for at least 24-48 hours after a concussion may potentially prevent motor vehicle accidents and, therefore, injury to the adolescent or to others.

2.5  

**Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be recommended to treat acute headache. Limit the use of these short-term acting medications to the first week post-injury and avoid “around-the-clock” dosing to prevent overuse or rebound headaches.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

Updated Sept 2023

2.6  

**At present, there is limited evidence to support the administration of intravenous medication to treat acute headaches in pediatric concussion patients in the Emergency Department setting.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png)

2.7  

**After assessment, nearly all children/adolescents with concussion may be safely discharged from clinics and Emergency Departments for observation at home.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

The decision to observe in the hospital will depend on clinical judgment. Indicators for longer in-hospital observation (or to return to emergency for re-assessment) may include:

*   Worsening symptoms (headache, confusion, irritability).
*   Decreased level of consciousness.
*   Prolonged clinical symptoms (persistent/prolonged vomiting, severe headache, etc.).
*   Bleeding disorders.
*   Multi-system injuries. 
*   Co-morbid symptoms. 

Other discharge considerations:

*   Observe the child/adolescent for a period of time to verify that they do not develop “red flag” symptoms prior to discharge. Use clinical judgment.
*   Verify that the child/adolescent has a normal mental status (alertness/behaviour/cognition) and their symptoms are improving prior to discharge. 
*   Verify that an assessment of clinical risk factors indicating the need for a CT scan was performed or a normal result was obtained if a CT scan was performed prior to discharge.
*   See [Recommendation 2.1c](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/2/#rec-202) for more information on when to consider diagnostic brain or cervical spine imaging.

2.8  

**Recommend a medical follow-up visit in 1-2 weeks to re-assess and monitor clinical status.** **Recommend an immediate medical follow-up in the presence of any deterioration.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

Those with a confirmed diagnosis of concussion may be managed by a healthcare professional who within their formally designated scope of practice has the capacity to manage ongoing concussion-related symptoms.

2.9  

**Provide post-concussion information and a written medical assessment to the child/adolescent and the parent/caregiver prior to sending the child/adolescent home.** 

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

Write the discharge note/written medical assessment with the following information:

*   The outcome of the initial medical assessment.
*   Indicate to the child/adolescent and their parents, teachers, and coaches if they have been medically cleared to participate in full-contact sports or high-risk activities.

*   In any child/adolescent who sustains a significant impact to the head, face, neck, or body and demonstrates/exhibits any of the visual signs of a suspected concussion or reports any symptoms of a suspected concussion as detailed in the [Concussion Recognition Tool 6](https://pedsconcussion.com/crt6/) (Tool 1.2). 

Premature return to activities and sport can lead to another injury. Another blow to the head may complicate the injury further and result in a longer recovery time (i.e, higher risk of persisting symptoms). Severe brain swelling or cerebral edema after a concussion is very rare but potentially fatal.

1.3  

**Recommend an emergency medical assessment for a child/adolescent with any of the “red flag” symptoms.** 

If a child/adolescent demonstrates any of the ‘Red Flags’ symptoms indicated by the [Concussion Recognition Tool 6](https://pedsconcussion.com/crt6/), a more severe head or spine injury should be suspected and an emergency medical assessment is required. **These red flag symptoms may appear immediately or within a few hours or days after injury.** Delayed red flag symptoms require urgent medical assessment as they may indicate a more severe injury. Consider arranging an ambulance service as necessary to facilitate urgent medical assessment at the nearest hospital and execution of the Emergency Action Plan for your organization. When calling an ambulance, describe the specific red flags symptoms over the phone. 

Red flag symptoms include:

*   Severe or increasing headache 
*   Neck pain or tenderness
*   Double vision or loss of vision
*   Weakness or numbness/tingling in extremities
*   Seizure or convulsions
*   Loss of consciousness
*   Increased confusion or deteriorating conscious state
*   Repeated vomiting
*   Increasingly restless, agitated or combative state
*   Slurred speech 
*   Visible skill deformity

1.4   

**Concussion should be suspected and diagnosed as soon as possible to maintain health and improve outcomes. Concussion can be suspected in the community by healthcare professionals, parents, teachers, coaches, and peers. Those with a suspected concussion should be assessed by a physician or nurse practitioner to perform a thorough medical assessment to exclude more severe injuries, consider a full differential diagnosis, and confirm the diagnosis of concussion.** 

**It is important to note that some patients may experience a delayed onset of concussion symptoms. Delayed concussion symptoms also require medical assessment to exclude more severe injuries.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

On re-evaluation, experienced health professionals (and school-based educational professionals where available) should manage school cognitive difficulties, provide accommodations, and reduce stressors. This should be done in collaboration with the child/adolescent, parents/caregivers, schools and/or employers to support success in the home, school, and community.

Refer to an interdisciplinary concussion team and/or a school-based educational professional (if available) if symptoms interfere with daily functioning more than 4 weeks following a concussion (Domain 9: [Cognition](https://pedsconcussion.com/section/b/#domain-9)). Refer for a formal evaluation if school difficulties may have been pre-existing.

Use tools to encourage reintegration within the school, employment, sports, social, and home environments.

5.1  

**Refer a child/adolescent with multiple concussions or baseline conditions associated with concussion-like symptoms to an interdisciplinary concussion team to help with return to full-contact sports or high-risk activities or retirement decisions from full-contact sports or high-risk activities.**

Return to full-contact sport or high-risk activity decisions can be complicated for children/adolescents with more complex medical histories. The following factors should be taken into consideration in the discussion and decisions made about return-to-sport or retirement: 

*   Concussion history.
*   Co-morbidities (e.g., learning and communication deficits, ADHD, physical disabilities, psychiatric disorders).
*   Absolute contraindications for return-to-sport and high-risk activities.
*   Early recurrence or greater frequency of symptoms.
*   Lower injury threshold.
*   Increasing recovery time.
*   Potential short- and long-term sequelae.

Some patients may benefit from neuropsychological assessment to determine resolution of cognitive problems. If a post-injury cognitive or neuropsychological assessment is deemed clinically necessary, it is recommended that this assessment be interpreted by a pediatric neuropsychologist.

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

5.2  

**Baseline testing on children/adolescents using concussion assessment tools or tests (or any combination of tests/tools) is not recommended or required for concussion diagnosis or management following an injury.** 

See the [Parachute Statement on Baseline Testing](https://parachute.ca/en/professional-resources/statement-on-concussion-baseline-testing-in-canada/) for more information (Parachute Canada). 

“Baseline testing refers to the practice of having an athlete complete certain concussion assessment tools/tests prior to sports participation to provide baseline measurements that can be compared to post-injury values in the event of a suspected concussion. Current evidence does not support a significant added benefit of baseline testing athletes. This includes the Child SCAT5 and the SCAT5 tools, as well as neuropsychological and neurocognitive tests, both computerized or not.” ([Parachute Statement on Baseline Testing](https://parachute.ca/en/professional-resources/statement-on-concussion-baseline-testing-in-canada/))

See [Recommendation 5.3](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/5/#rec-316): Special considerations regarding baseline testing.

Level of Evidence:  ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

5.3  

**Special considerations regarding baseline testing.**

Please consult the [Parachute Statement on Baseline Testing](https://parachute.ca/en/professional-resources/statement-on-concussion-baseline-testing-in-canada/) for more information (Parachute Canada).

“There may be unique athlete populations and sports environments where baseline testing may be considered. These situations should be considered the exception and not the rule.” 

*   “Clinical neuropsychologists may consider baseline cognitive or neuropsychological testing in select youth athletes (greater than 12 years old) who have pre-existing conditions, such as a history of previous concussion, ADHD, or learning disorders, that may impact the interpretation of post-injury test results.”
*   “Certain teams and sporting federations have well-established physician-supervised concussion protocols with dedicated experienced healthcare professionals working directly and continuously with youth athletes (i.e., that are present at training and competition events). In these sport environments, baseline testing may be considered as an optional assessment within the comprehensive concussion protocol as long as the medical teams caring for these athletes include experienced healthcare professionals who have competency-based training and clinical experience to allow them to administer and interpret these tests.”

4.1  

**Consider patients for medical clearance to return to full-contact activities and sport/game play if clinical criteria have been met.**

The following clinical criteria should be considered or met before recommending that a child/adolescent returns to full-contact activities and sport/game play: 

*   ‘Return-to-Learn’: Return to pre-injury learning activities with no new academic support, including school accommodations or learning adjustments. Child/adolescent has successfully returned to all school activities including writing exams without symptoms above their previous pre-injury level or requiring accommodations related to their concussion/post-concussion symptoms, (i.e., child/adolescent may have pre-existing accommodations or new accommodations related to something other than their concussion).
*   Normal neurological and cervical spine examination.
*   ‘Complete symptom resolution’:  Resolution of symptoms associated with the current concussion at rest with no return of symptoms during or after maximal physical and cognitive exertion (back to the pre-injury state in patients with pre-existing conditions such as baseline headaches or mental health conditions). 
*   Return-to-Sport: Completion of the  [Return to Activity/Sport protocol](https://pedsconcussion.com/return-to-activity-sport-school/) with no symptoms and no clinical findings associated with the current concussion at rest and with maximal physical exertion.
*    No longer taking any drugs or substances atypical to their pre-injury functioning that could mask symptom presentation.

For children/adolescents with complex medical histories (e.g., repeated concussion, baseline concussion-like symptoms), see [Recommendation 5.1](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/5/#rec-314) for information regarding returning to full-contact sports or high-risk activities, or retirement from full-contact sports or high-risk activities.

6.2d  

**Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be recommended to treat acute headache. Advise on limiting the use of these medications to less than 15 days a month and avoiding “around-the-clock” dosing to prevent overuse or rebound headaches. I.e., advise that children/adolescents avoid using over the counter medications at regular scheduled times throughout the day.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

6.3  

**Refer patients who have prolonged post-concussion headaches for more than 4 weeks to an interdisciplinary concussion team or to a sub-specialist for further evaluation and management. Consider early referral (prior to 4-weeks after the acute injury) to an interdisciplinary concussion team in the presence of modifiers that may delay recovery.**

Prolonged headaches in pediatric concussion patients can be difficult to classify and manage and can co-occur with other prolonged post-concussion symptoms (dizziness, neck pain, sleep disturbance, cognitive or mood challenges). 

If an interdisciplinary concussion team member is not available:

*   Consider appropriate referral to interdisciplinary professionals who have competency-based training and clinical experience to independently manage the identified headaches and headache disorders.

If a child/adolescent with prolonged post-concussion headache has not had a recent vision assessment, refer to an optometrist for an assessment.

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

6.4  

**Consider initiating pharmacological therapy to treat and manage prolonged headaches while waiting for the interdisciplinary concussion team or sub-specialist referral.** 

For patients with post-traumatic headaches that are migrainous in nature, the use of migraine-specific abortants such as triptan class medications may be used if effective. Due to the risk of developing medication-induced headaches, limit use of abortants to fewer than 6-10 days per month.

15.1  

**Considerations for a Virtual Medical Assessment.**

**_See Recommendation 2.1 “Physicians or nurse practitioners should perform a comprehensive medical assessment on all children/adolescents with a suspected concussion or with acute head or spine trauma._**  
_• Include a clinical history, physical examination, and the evidence-based use of diagnostic tests or imaging as needed.”_

**In-person medical assessments are ideal for all children/adolescents with suspected or diagnosed concussion, however, telemedicine may be considered to assist in the medical assessment for patients who meet the following criteria:**  
**• A previous medical assessment by a physician or nurse practitioner has been performed.**  
**• Access or travel for an in-person medical assessment is limited or difficult**  
**• There is no history of abnormal diagnostic imaging (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, spine or facial fracture)**

**Note: All providers should be aware of current public health recommendations when providing care to their patients.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

15.1a  

**Obtain informed consent from the patient and/or their parent/caregiver to conduct a remote medical assessment via telemedicine.**

This process should outline the benefits and limitations of performing clinical care via telemedicine as well as taking measures to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Discuss the important limitation of not being able to perform some aspects of the physical examination virtually (e.g., testing of motor or sensory functioning, fundoscopy, etc.) and outline what arrangements will be made to facilitate an urgent in-person assessment as needed to optimize clinical care.

15.1d  

**Considerations for a virtual physical assessment**

A virtual physical examination should aim to assess similar aspects of neurological functioning evaluated during an in-person medical assessment with modifications based on the presence of a remote telepresenter or examiner.

*   The unassisted virtual physical examination should include assessment of mental status, speech, cranial nerves, coordination, balance, gait, cognitive functioning, oculomotor functioning, and the cervical spine.
*   Certain aspects of the physical examination including assessment of motor, sensory and vestibular functioning; palpation and provocative testing of the cervical spine; testing of visual acuity and deep tendon reflexes; as well as fundoscopic and otoscopic examinations cannot be performed virtually.

**Provide a medical follow-up assessment on children/adolescents with concussion in 1-2 weeks to re-assess and monitor clinical status. A regular medical follow-up is also recommended if a child/adolescent is still experiencing post-concussion symptoms or has not completed the return-to-school or return-to-sport/activity stages.** **Recommend immediate in-person medical attention in the presence of any deterioration.**

While in-person medical follow-up is ideal, telemedicine (e.g., real-time in-person videoconferencing) may be considered for follow-up appointments for the following patients with concussion:

1.  Those for whom access or travel for follow-up is limited or unavailable such as those who live in rural and remote communities.
2.  Those who have undergone a previous in-person medical assessment by the treating physician or nurse practitioner
3.  Those whose symptoms are stable, improving, or resolved
4.  Those who do not report any subjective red flags (e.g., blurred or double vision, weakness or numbness, vertigo) and who have a satisfactory virtual physical examination with no objective red flags (e.g., diplopia on extraocular movement testing, positive pronator drift, pain on testing of cervical spine range of motion)
5.  Those who do not require supplemental testing (diagnostic imaging, neuropsychological testing, graded aerobic exercise testing), and/or inter-disciplinary referrals to optimize patient care

15.6  

**Recommendations for inter-disciplinary healthcare professionals involved in the care of concussion patients:**

**Neuropsychologists**

Virtual care may be considered to assist in the assessment and longitudinal care of concussion patients who develop persistent cognitive and mood-related symptoms or who are having persistent problems in school. Neuropsychologists should be aware of the limitations of performing certain neuropsychological tests via in-person videoconferencing. Specific symptom assessments can be administered virtually or completed before the virtual appointment and sent to the neuropsychologist ahead of time.

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

**Physiotherapists**

Virtual care may be considered by physiotherapists to advance vestibular, cervical spine and medically supervised individually tailored sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise treatment plans in patients who have undergone previous in-person assessment by the treating physiotherapist. Physiotherapists should recognize that a comprehensive assessment of the cervical spine and vestibular system as well as graded aerobic exercise testing, which are required to provide initial recommendations regarding targeted rehabilitation, cannot be performed virtually. If a physiotherapist is providing virtual care, they must be able to arrange an urgent in-person assessment as needed.

10.2  

**Screen for oculomotor or vision deficits.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

Perform an assessment of visual acuity, pupillary function, visual fields, fundoscopy, and extra-ocular movements.

*   With appropriate experience, consider an objective assessment of convergence, accommodation, saccades and smooth pursuits.
*   Consider additional tests such as automated visual field testing, formal vestibular testing or diagnostic imaging.

Consider referral to an interdisciplinary concussion team or neuro-ophthalmologist, neuro-optometrist, developmental optometrist, occupational therapist, or physiotherapist with competency-based training in vestibular rehabilitation to assess for impairments in convergence, accommodation, saccades and other visual oculomotor disorders.

Online instructional video to consider:

*   Link: [Visio-Vestibular Examination](https://pedsconcussion.com/vve) (The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia).

10.3  

**Screen for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) if the patient reports vertigo or dizziness that occurs for seconds following position changes and consider targeted particle re-positioning manoeuvres.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

After completing a neurological screen and clearing the cervical spine to move into the test position, perform the Dix-Hallpike Test. If positive for BPPV (i.e., reproduction of vertigo, typically for seconds, in addition to a characteristic pattern of nystagmus for the canal that is being assessed), a Particle Repositioning Manoeuvre may be appropriate.

Consider the Epley Manoeuvre which can be used to treat the anterior and posterior canals in the case of a canalithiasis. There are many subtypes of BPPV that may require further assessment or alternate canalith repositioning manoeuvres and referral to a healthcare professional (often a physiotherapist with competency-based training in vestibular rehabilitation) for treatment.  If symptoms are provoked by pressure (i.e., val salva) or accompanied by a change in hearing, referral to an otolaryngologist or neuro-otologist is warranted.    

In patients who continue to experience prolonged vertigo or dizziness despite 3 particle repositioning maneouvers, consider referral to an interdisciplinary concussion team or neuro-otologist or physiotherapist with competency-based training in vestibular rehabilitation. These experienced healthcare professionals should rule out alternative peripheral and central vestibular disorders (e.g., superior semi-circular canal dehiscence (SSCD), vestibular hypofunction) and initiate active management with rehabilitation or referral as appropriate.

Assessment by an interdisciplinary concussion team can assist in identifying the type of management that is required, along with the medical and health professions on the interdisciplinary concussion team or external to this team who can provide the required management. Not all children/adolescents will require care from all members of the interdisciplinary concussion team and care should be targeted based on identified symptoms and patient needs.

See Recommendation 2.1b: [Note any modifiers that may delay recovery and use a clinical risk score to predict risk of prolonged symptoms.](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/2/#rec-200)

## Cognition
##### Recommendations

### LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-a-legend.png)A = Consistent, good-quality, patient-oriented evidence (example: at least one large randomized control trial, meta-analysis or systematic review with homogeneity, or large, high- quality, multi-centre cohort study)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-b-legend.png)B = Inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence (example: smaller cohort studies, case studies or control trials with limitations)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-c-legend.png)C = Consensus, usual practice, opinion or weaker-level evidence

  

9.1  

**Evaluate a child/adolescent for cognitive symptoms that interfere with daily functioning following the acute injury.** 

Level of Evidence:  ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-B.png) 

For symptoms that interfere with daily functioning for more than 4 weeks following acute injury, further evaluation by experienced professionals to assess cognitive problems may be required. 

Depending on the nature of the cognitive symptoms, examples of professionals may include:

*   Experienced educational professionals.
*   Pediatric neuropsychologists.
*   Occupational therapists.
*   Speech language pathologists.

Other assessments may be required to determine the underlying cause(s) and any pre-existing contributing factors that can be managed:

*   Use a risk score to assess any modifiers that may delay recovery ([Recommendation 2.1b](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/2/#rec-200)).
*   A mental health assessment and a closer look at the family may be recommended (Domain 8: [Mental Health](https://pedsconcussion.com/section/b/#domain-8)).
*   Vision, vestibular, and hearing assessments may be recommended (Domain 10: [Vision, Vestibular, and Oculomotor Function](https://pedsconcussion.com/section/b/#domain-10)).
*   Physical examination (Tool 2.1: [Physical Examination](https://pedsconcussion.com/pedsconcussion-physical-examination/)).
*   As per usual pediatric clinical practice, broad clinical history taking is recommended to understand the youth’s developmental, medical, social, academic, and family histories. Particular consideration should be given to the interplay between these pre-existing factors and current cognitive profile/presentation/symptoms.

9.2  

**Manage cognitive symptoms that interfere with daily functioning for more than 4 weeks following acute injury.**

## Fatigue
##### Recommendations

### LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-a-legend.png)A = Consistent, good-quality, patient-oriented evidence (example: at least one large randomized control trial, meta-analysis or systematic review with homogeneity, or large, high- quality, multi-centre cohort study)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-b-legend.png)B = Inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence (example: smaller cohort studies, case studies or control trials with limitations)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-c-legend.png)C = Consensus, usual practice, opinion or weaker-level evidence

  

11.1  

**Perform a repeat medical assessment on all patients presenting with post-concussion fatigue 1-2 weeks following acute injury.** 

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

The medical assessment should include a clinical history of symptoms, physical examination, and screen for other causes of fatigue (e.g., mononucleosis, anemia, thyroid dysfunction, mood disorders, pregnancy, etc.).

11.2  

**Provide patients with post-concussion fatigue with general education and guidance that outlines non-pharmacological strategies to help cope with fatigue symptoms and set expectations.** 

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

Strategies and post-concussion education guidance related to fatigue:

*   Emphasize that spreading activities throughout the day helps patients achieve more and that they should avoid doing too much at once.
    *   Tool 2.5 [“Four P’s” – Prioritize, Plan, Pace and Position](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tool-2.5-Four-Ps-Prioritize-Plan-Pace-and-Position-draft.pdf).
*   Encourage good diet and hydration.
*   Encourage good sleep hygiene.
    *   Tool 2.7: [Strategies to Promote Good Sleep and Alertness](https://pedsconcussion.com/tool-2-7-strategies-to-promote-good-sleep-and-alertness/).
*   Avoid daytime napping.
*   Identify the triggers of fatigue.
*   Encourage the child/adolescent to plan meaningful goals, record activity achievement, and identify patterns of fatigue by using a notebook or diary.
*   Link: [Sleep for Youth. CHEO Sleep Hygiene handout](https://pedsconcussion.com/cheo-sleep-for-youth-handout/)
*   Inform that fatigue can be worsened by low mood or stress. 
*   Inform that deconditioning can compound fatigue.
*   Encourage a gradual return to school with accommodation (Domain 12: [Return-to-School and Work](https://pedsconcussion.com/section/b/#domain-12)).

11.3  

**Encourage patients with post-concussion fatigue to engage in cognitive activity and low-risk physical activity as soon as tolerated while staying below their symptom-exacerbation thresholds. Activities that pose no/low risk of sustaining a concussion (no risk of contact, collision, or falling) should be resumed even if mild residual symptoms are present or whenever acute symptoms improve sufficiently to permit activity.**

**See [Recommendation 2.3](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/2/#rec-614).**

*   **Refer select patients (e.g., highly-active or competitive athletes, those who are not tolerating a graduated return to physical activity, or those who are slow to recover) following acute injury to a medically supervised interdisciplinary team with the ability to individually assess sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise tolerance and to prescribe aerobic exercise treatment. This exercise tolerance assessment can be as early as 48 hours following acute injury.** Level of Evidence:![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-A.png)
*   **Patients who are active may benefit from referral to a medically supervised interdisciplinary team with the ability to individually assess sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise tolerance and to prescribe aerobic exercise treatment. This exercise tolerance assessment can be as early as 48 hours following acute injury.** Level of Evidence:![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

## Biomarkers - Neuroimaging
##### Recommendations

### LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-a-legend.png)A = Consistent, good-quality, patient-oriented evidence (example: at least one large randomized control trial, meta-analysis or systematic review with homogeneity, or large, high- quality, multi-centre cohort study)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-b-legend.png)B = Inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence (example: smaller cohort studies, case studies or control trials with limitations)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-c-legend.png)C = Consensus, usual practice, opinion or weaker-level evidence

  

13.1  

**At this stage, advanced neuroimaging biomarkers are not yet ready for clinical implementation/management.** 

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

Biomarkers such as functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), arterial spin labeling (ASL), cerebrovascular-reactivity mapping (CVR), quantitative susceptibility based susceptibility weighted imaging (qSWI), electroencephalography/event-related potential (EEG/ERP), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), while potentially useful as research tools, are not ready for clinical implementation.

13.2  

**When conventional MRI is performed in the clinical management of concussion patients, the inclusion of susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) sequences could be considered as it may be useful for detecting small hemorrhages. The clinical significance of small hemorrhages on SWI is not clear at present.** 

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)

See [Recommendation 2.1c](https://pedsconcussion.com/domain/2/#rec-202) for more information on when to consider diagnostic brain or cervical spine imaging.

## Biomarkers - Serologic
##### Recommendations

### LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-a-legend.png)A = Consistent, good-quality, patient-oriented evidence (example: at least one large randomized control trial, meta-analysis or systematic review with homogeneity, or large, high- quality, multi-centre cohort study)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-b-legend.png)B = Inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence (example: smaller cohort studies, case studies or control trials with limitations)![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/level-c-legend.png)C = Consensus, usual practice, opinion or weaker-level evidence

  

14.1  

**The use of serologic biomarkers is not clinically indicated. Presently there is no validated “concussion blood test” that can be used to accurately detect concussion in children/adolescents.**

Level of Evidence: ![](https://pedsconcussion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Level-C.png)  

At this stage, newer serologic and other clinical biomarkers, while potentially useful as research tools, are not ready for clinical implementation/management.
